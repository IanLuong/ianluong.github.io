            Born and raised in East London, I'm a junior full-stack web
            developer and a Computer Science graduate from King's College
            London.

            My primary focus is accessibility, writing clean JavaScript and
            modern CSS. I mostly use React, Node and MongoDB but I can adapt to
            whatever is required. Learning new techonologies is part of the
            game. I currently work with JavaScript, React, Node.js and Tailwind
            CSS to build quality web apps.

            Outside of web development, I love playing{' '}
            <span className="font-semibold">badminton</span> in my free time. I
            also play <span className="font-semibold">video games</span> (right
            now I'm playing <span className="font-medium">Celeste</span> and{' '}
            <span className="font-medium">Resident Evil 3 Remake</span>!) on top
            of building and decorating{' '}
            <span className="font-medium">Gunpla model kits</span>. I collect
            vinyl records too. Let me know your favourite album and I'll check
            it out.
