            I am a Computer Science graduate from King's College London looking
            to leave my mark on the World Wide Web, becoming a self-taught web
            developer and learning to embrace my creative side.

          <p>
            I currently work with JavaScript, React, Node.js and Tailwind CSS to
            build quality web apps.

            Born and raised in London, I've grown up looking to help people
            around me and love to make others smile and laugh (I previously
            worked as a tutor, teaching children aged 8-14). As a result, I
            strive everyday to find laughter in life and transform problems into
            elegant solutions.

            free time. I also love to play video games whenever I feel the need
